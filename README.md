Run the Jupyter Notebook, and sequentially execute the python cell blocks by
using Shift+Enter. 

When the notebook prompts you for an Excel spreadsheet
name as input, make sure the file you want to restructure in included in the
folder you are working out of, and enter its filename. The rest of the notebook will work sequentially,
without further input. 

The restructured output file can be found in the current folder, under
'restructured_' + the original filename given at the user prompt.
