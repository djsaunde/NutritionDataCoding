# Instructions

Go into the code/ directory, and run 'python make_sheet.py'. Follow the prompts
to enter in the file name of the workbook to restructure, and the name of the sheet
you'd like to work with on this iteration.

The restructured output file can be found in the current folder, under
'restructured_' + the original filename given at the user prompt.
