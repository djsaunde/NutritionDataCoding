Here are a list of recurring problems I've found while working through the
nutrition data spreadsheets:

- Bolded text in cells which do not contain product category information. For 
example, there are some cells which have a bolded period at the end of the text,
and this causing the script I wrote to misclassify the cell as containing
product category information. This might be avoidable with a certain rule,
however.
- Certain brand names are not always encased in parentheses. For example,
search for 'Flamethrower' in the first full workbook. This causes the script
I wrote to lump this string into whatever type of information it is adjacent
to. In this case, it becomes part of the serving size.
- Sometimes there is text inside of parentheses which does not correspond to
a brand name (e.g., '(25% fat)'), which causes a false positive on the brand name.
