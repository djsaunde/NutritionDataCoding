Brand Hierarchy

    Product Category (one for each entry):
        -listed in bold (use openpyxl to identify this).
        -sorted alphabetically.
        -applies to every cell below until next bolded word appears (every 
            product below will have this product category).
    
    Product Description (only some entries have one):
        -description ends with a semicolon (check for this with simple string
            operation or regex).
        -sorted alphabetically.
        -applies to every cell below unti next (1) product description or (2)
            next bolded word appears (check with two string ops / regexes).
        -often, but not always, listed in a separate row from the product 
            category. if it is in the same row, it will be separated by a comma.
            discerning this will require understanding of where the bold font
            of the product category begins and ends.
            
    Type (only some entries have one):
        -appears in one of two ways:
            (1) before the parentheses containing the Brand Name (see below),
            in the same cell. these rows will also contain the desired nutrition
            information.
            (2) in the rows following the brand name, corresponding to the 
            different variations on the brand. these rows will also contain the
            desired nutrition information.
            
    Brand Name (only some entries have one):
        -contained in parentheses and typically is italicized. "(cont.)" is a 
        false positive (not a brand name).
        -applies to every cell below until either (1) a new brand appears, or
        (2) a new product description appears, or (3) a new product category
        appears.
        -sorted alphabetically.
        
    Serving Size (one for each entry):
        -listed either as:
            (1) in the same cell as Product Category, after the bolded text. 
            watch out for "except as noted".
            (2) in the same cell as Product Description, after the Product
            Description. watch out for "except as noted".
            (3) in the same cell as Brand name, after parenthetical text.
        -comes in various units (e.g., pkg., pcs., tbsp., oz.)
        -if not stated in the Brand Name cell, use default Serving Size found
            in the Product Description. If this fails, use the default in
            the Product Category.
